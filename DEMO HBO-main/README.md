# Getting started
Riskmethods Coding Challenge

# Challenge:
Create a simple iOS app that allows the user to search for movies. The end project will be evaluated for code quality, architecture and UI/UX of end product.

# Requirements:
• Should be developed in swift, can use Storyboard or create UI programmatically. As for the UI please DO NOT USE SwiftUI
• The application should have
o Search bar
o Display results in a list fetched from above API (can be table view / collection view) o Each Item in list should have movie poster image, movie name, movie overview and
release date in following format – Nov 30, 1982 .
o Each Item should have a button with two possible states – “Not watched” and
“Watched”. The button should start in “Not watched” state
o When this button is clicked there is a transition to “Watched” state. This button has
no dependency on data from API. (To save your time - No need to save this information, this watched / not watched state gets expired when user quits the app. However you can use save this info in device if you want)
• Tapping on a cell should open the selected movie details in the default system browser. Sample URL - https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/
• At least one unit test.

# My Comments:
1- I recently worked on a project for Apple TV. and Live TV app so I had some very clear references.
2- I could have reduced even more the dependencies with the use of storyboard but for a very small app I didn't think it was necessary.
3- My main focus is on what I really feel competent in and is my strong point at the moment and that is "Automation test".
4- Cucumber is the only Framework used for Automation test.
5- It was necessary to create an APY KEY since the document does not provide one.
6- I have configured CI/CD but I have not been able to configure the runner for Automation test because 
I have the limit of available Runnes occupied, they are done when pushing a branch.

# We want you to be product oriented, and a proactive problem solver — you understand that ultimately what matters is the product we ship; not the code we write.
These are your words in the announcement 
This is what caught my attention
for a long time I see companies that focus on finding the best developer in the world but lose attention on the product they deliver.
My vision is the same 
For me the most important thing is not how nice the code looks, it's what the customer receives  
Swift is changing over time
The good synthesys of the past are obsolete today. 
good synthansys today will be obsolete tomorrow
